# First Beatsaber Map

Okay, so I've decided to use my study period today to start working on Hacksaber instead of working on an English essay I have due this Friday...is this a mistake? I hope not! Anyways, I'm stuck between two songs that I really like. One is more silly, and I think I might get tired of listening to it over and over (Sometimes I'm Alone (Lonely Cat) by The Kiffness), and the other is a slower version of one of my favorite songs (Stargazing - Moonlight Version by Myles Smith). I think I need to see which one of these songs I can actually purchase online to get a high quality audio file.

I installed Chromapper, and now I just need to purchase Stargazing - Moonlight Version off of qobuz!
